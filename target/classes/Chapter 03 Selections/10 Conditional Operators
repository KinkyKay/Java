A conditional operator evaluates an expression based on a condition.

    The syntax to use the operator is as follows:

        boolean-expression ? expression1 : expression2

    The result of this expression is expression1 if boolean-expression is true; otherwise the result is expression2.


Operator Precedence and Associativity
Operator precedence and associativity determine the order in which operators are evaluated.

        1   var++ and var--
        2   +, -,(unary plus and minus) ++var, --var
        3   ! (Not)
        4   *, /, %
        5   +, -
        6   <, <=, >, >=
        7   ==, != (Equality)
        8   ^ (Exclusive OR)
        9   $$ (AND)
        10  || (OR)
        11  =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=
