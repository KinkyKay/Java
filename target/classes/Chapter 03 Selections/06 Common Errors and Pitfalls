Forgetting necessary braces, ending an if statement in the wrong place, mistaking == for =, and dangling else clauses
are common errors in selection statements. Duplicated statements in if-else statements and testing equality of double
values are common pitfalls

    * Common Error 1 : Forgetting Necessary Braces

    * Common Error 2 : Wrong Semicolon at the if Line

    * Common Error 3 : Redundant Testing of Boolean Values

    * Common Error 4 : Dangling else Ambiguity

    * Common Error 5 : Equality Test of Two Floating-Point Values

    * Common Pitfall 1 : Simplifying Boolean Variable Assignment

    * Common Pitfall 2 : Avoiding Duplicate Code in Different Cases
