Common elementary programming errors often involve underdeclared variables, uninitialized variables, integer overflow,
unintended integer division, and round-off errors.

Common Error 1: Undeclared/Uninitialized variables and unused variables
	Double interestRate = 0.05;
	Double interest = interestrate * 45;
Interestrate has not been declared and initialized.

Common Error 2: Integer Overflow
When a variable is assigned a value that is too large to be stored, it causes overflow.
When a floating-point number is too small to be stored, it causes underflow.

Common Error 3: Round-off Errors
Also called a rounding error, is the difference between the calculated approximation of a number and its
mathematical value.

Common Error 4: Unintended integer Division

Common Pitfall 1: Redundant Input Objects
	Scanner input = new Scanner (System.in);
	System.out.println("Enter an integer: ");
	Int v1 = input.nextInt();

	Scanner input1 = new Scanner(System.in);    // BAD CODE
	System.out.println("Enter a double value: ");
	Double v2 = input1.nextDouble();

	Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);      // GOOD CODE
	System.out.println("Enter an integer: ");
	Int v1 = input.nextInt();
	System.out.println("Enter a double value: ");
	Double v2 = input.nextDouble();
