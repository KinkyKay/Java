The operators +, -, *, /, and % can be combined with the assignment operator to form augmented operators.

Operator    	Name    	            Example     	Equivalent
+=      	Addition assignment	        i += 8	        i = i + 8
-=	        Subtraction assignment	    i -= 8	        i = i - 8
*=	        Multiplication assignment	i *= 8	        i = i * 8
/=	        Division assignment	        i /= 8	        i = i / 8
%=	        Remainder assignment	    i %= 8	        i = i % 8
