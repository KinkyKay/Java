Java has six numeric types for integers and floating-point numbers with operators + , - , * ,  / , and %.

9.1. Numeric Types
Eight primitive data types for numeric values, characters and Boolean values:

Java uses four types for integers: byte, short, int and long and two types for floating-point numbers:
float and double.

9.2. Reading Numbers from the Keyboard
You can also use the methods to read a number of the byte, short, int, long and float type.

Methods for Scanner Objects:
Method	Description
nextByte()	    Reads an integer of the byte type.
nextShort()	    Reads an integer of the short type.
nextInt()	    Reads an integer of the int type.
nextLong()	    Reads an integer of the long type.
nextFloat() 	Reads an integer of the float type.
nextDouble()	Reads an integer of the double type.
