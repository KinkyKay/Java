Java provides many useful methods in the Math class for performing common mathematical functions.

A method is a group of statements that perform a specific task. This section introduces other useful methods in the Math
class. They can be categorized as trigonometric methods, exponent methods, and service methods.
The Math class provides two useful double constant PI and E. You can use these constants as Math.PI and Math.E in any
program.

//----- TRIGONOMETRIC METHODS -----//
    METHOD                      DESCRIPTION
    sin                         Returns the trigonometric sine of an angle in radians.
    cos                         Returns the trigonometric cosine of an angle in radians.
    tan                         Returns the trigonometric tangent of an angle in radians.
    toRadians                   Returns the angle in radians for the angle in degrees.
    toDegrees                   Returns the angle in degrees for the angle in radians.
    asin                        Returns the angle in radians for the inverse of sine.
    acos                        Returns the angle in radians for the inverse of cosine.
    atan                        Returns the angle in radians for the inverse of tangent.

//----- EXPONENT METHODS -----//
    METHOD                      DESCRIPTION
    exp(x)                      Returns e raised to power of x.
    log(x)                      Returns the natural logarithm of x.
    log10(x)                    Returns the base 10 logarithm of x
    pow(a,b)                    Returns a raised to the power of b.
    sqrt(x)                     Returns the square root of x.

//----- THE ROUNDING METHODS -----//
    METHOD                      DESCRIPTION
    cell(x)                     x is rounded up to its nearest integer. This integer is returned as a double value.
    floor(x)                    x is rounded down to its nearest integer. This integer is returned as a double value.
    rint(x)                     x is rounded to its nearest integer. If x is equally close to two integers, the even one
                                is returned as a double value.
    round(x)                    Returns (int)Math.floor(x + 0.5) if x is a float and returns (long)Math.floor(x+0.5)
                                if x is a double.

//----- The min, max and abs Methods -----//
The min and max methods return the minimum and maximum numbers of two numbers.
The abs method returns the absolute value of the number.
    EXAMPLE:
        Math.max(2 , 3)     returns 3
        Math.min(2.5, 4.6)  returns 2.5
        Math.abs(-2.1)      returns 2.1

//----- The random Method -----//
This method generates a random double value greater than or equal to 0.0 and less than 1.0
    EXAMPLE:
        (int)(Math.random) * 10         Returns a random integer between 0 and 9.
        50 + (int)(Math.random() * 50)  Returns a random integer between 50 and 99.
