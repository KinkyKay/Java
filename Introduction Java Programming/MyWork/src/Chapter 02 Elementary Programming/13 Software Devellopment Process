                                            SOFTWARE DEVELLOPMENT PROCESS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The software development life cycle is a multistage process that includes requirements specification, analysis, design,
implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

Requirements specification is a formal process that seeks to understand the problem the software will adress, and to
document in detail what the software system needs to do.
System analysis seeks to analyze the data flow and to identify the system's input and output.
System design is to design a process for obtaining the output from the input.
The essence of the system analysis and design is input, process and output (IPO).
Implementation involves translating the system design into programs.
Testing ensures the code meets the requirements specification and weeds out bugs.
Deployment makes the software available for use.
Maintenance is concerned with updating and improving the product.
