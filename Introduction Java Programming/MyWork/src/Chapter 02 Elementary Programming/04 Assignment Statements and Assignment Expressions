An assignment statement designates a value for a variable. An assignment statement can be used as an expression in Java.

After a variable is declared, you can assign a value to it by using an assignment statement. The equal sign ( = ) is
used as these assignment operator. The syntax for assignment statements is as follows:

	Variable = expression;

An expression represents a computation involving values, variables, and operators that, taking them together,
evaluates to a value.
