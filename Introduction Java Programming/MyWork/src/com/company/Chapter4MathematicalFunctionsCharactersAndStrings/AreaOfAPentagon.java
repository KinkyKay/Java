    /* Write a program that prompts the user to enter the length from the center of a pentagon to a vertex (r) and
       computes the area of the pentagon.
       The formula is Area = (5 * pow(s,2)) / (4 * tan(PI / 5))
       s is the length of the side and can be computed using the formula s = 2r sin(PI / 5)
       r is the length from the center of a pentagon to a vertex. Round up two digits after the decimal point
       Sample run:
            Enter the length from the center to a vertex: 5,5
            The area of the pentagon is 71,92
