    // The two roots of a quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 can be obtained using the formula:
    // r1 = (-b + Math.pow(Math.pow(b,2) - (4 * a * c), 0.5)) / 2 * a
    // r2 = (-b - Math.pow(Math.pow(b,2) - (4 * a * c) , 0.5) / 2 * a
    // Math.pow(b,2) - 4ac is called the discriminant of the quadratic equation. If it is positive, the equation has
    // two real roots. If it is zero, the equation has one root. If it is negative, the equation has no real roots.
    // Writ a program that prompts the user to enter values for a, b, and c and displays the result based on the
    // discriminant. If the discriminant is positive, display two roots. If the discriminant is 0, display one root.
    // Otherwise, display "The equation has no real roots."
    // Sample: 1.0 - 3 - 1 ==> 2 roots -0.381966 and -2.61803
    // Sample: 1 - 2.0 - 1 ==> 1 root -1.0
    // Sample: 1 - 2 - 3 ==> no roots
